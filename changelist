    FIXs:
        * When the connection is lost now resubscribed. The fix is irrelevant if the messaging.client.mqtt.automaticReconnect is enabled.
        * The classifier evaluator is fixed, before was not working since version 1.1.1
        * The Nominal Data Descriptor is working properly again
        * LS-103 & LS-107 - now the /add is no more part of the PUT statement API. And the pub topic do not concatenate twice the ID

        * Small info (Logging) notifications improvements
        * The topics for the Statement API can be changed now
        * Now is possible to bootstrap the CEML request into the IoT-LA

        * The properties 'feeder.payload.type.class' and 'feeder.payload.type.alias' change name to 'connector.observers.payload.type.classes' and 'connector.observers.type.aliases', respectively
        * The property 'feeder.payload.type.topic' was removed, now is used the new property 'api.events.mqtt.topics.incoming' as described above.
        * Add customization of Autoregressive NN
    DEV:
        * The order of loading initialization has changed. Now looks as following:
            being: '->' followed by, ':' including the process, inside of '()' is  sub sequence of process, inside of '[]' optional sequence, inside of '||' parallel(-like) process):
                initConf->CEP:(engine->loadEngineTypes)->ForcePackageLoading:[CEML:Core->API:(FILE->MQTT)]->Feeders:(Event->Statement->Bootstrapping)->Connector(File->MQTT)->[|ConnectorREST[,CEML_REST_API]|]

        * the URL generation of the broker was ignoring the port
        * the G MQ LA was not taking the correct conf.cfg file. It's fix, but the reason why the G MQ DPA builds different to the G MQ LA it's still unknown.

        * CRUD CEML MQTT API is now complete
        * add SenML into the supported in the data-payloads
        * add a serialization abstraction. Now serializing and deserializing can be done without knowing the underlying implementation
        * separate the Feeders (high level API related component) from the Connectors (protocol related component)
        * BIG Change: The configuration file has being restructured:
            * all properties had changed its names.
            * The logic and concepts how the brokers had bing changed

    DEV:
        * Change List added
        * BootstrappingBean it's now part of API artifact
        * (De)serializers are new part of Utils
        * the CEML MQTT API had being adjusted to fit in the architecture of the agents (API now is MQTTIncomingObserver based)

        * removed the OSGi related code from some components
        * restructuring namespaces for make it homogeneous: change naming, moving classes, remove old namespace, etc
        * moved the out of date payload to a non-usable location till are up to date
        * add a new fine exception handling in the agent framework

    FIXs:
        * include non-connection related configuration settings now are also discriminator for comparison between two BrokerService(s)
        * the BootstrappingBean had being fixed
        * the bootstrapping of data types in the engine is fully functional again

31.08.2016 - 1.3.1 RELEASE:
    Features:
        * Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for GET request from web browsers. Currently enabled for predictions
        * Improve the CEML API to be RESTful compliant
        * add the double functionality in list handler. One, an independent ground truth (evaluation), target (learning), learning input, prediction Input. Two, same input ground truth (evaluation) = target (learning), learning input = prediction input
        * Add lase evaluation into the model.
        * add insertion of the CEML request into the CEP engine.
        * remove the necessity to define min and max bound in the Auto-regressive NNM
        * Providing original input in the prediction, therefore adapt some functions that use the prediction class
        * Parameters to decide high and low input values. Now "Model" should have an additional attribute for AutoregressiveNeuralNetworkModel:
                "Parameters":{
                "maxInputval":100.0,
                "minInputval":1.0
                }
        * add some configuration properties needed to configure jetty security in the conf.cfg file
        * the newest WSO2 CEP is working now with the agents
        * unifying the jetty conf file with the agent conf file
    DEV:
        * starting the Docker integration (unfinished)
        * big refactoring (name changed, packages, etc.) to fit better in the architecture and to be more homogeneous
        * GC Utils move back to Event namespace (welcome back). Now it is simply Utils
        * improve code stile in several. The room for improvement areas were pointed out by sonar Qube
        * handlers now are not a single process of packing, serializing, and publishing. Now this is done in different by a Serializer, Enveloper, and Publisher. Now, there is a MQTT Publisher (default) and a HTTP Publisher. The HTTP publisher allows the agent to generate REST request
        * improving the EventType and provide a basic implantation.
        * change the SSL socket to reduce unnecessary dependencies
    FIXs:
        * RMSE Evaluator and MAE evaluator: changed logic
        * evaluation with list learning handler.
        * fixing some minor auxiliary functions
        * Avoiding possible race conditions on learning process
        * the issue that the Evaluation Metric was always "More"
        * some handlers issues regarding the casting of the handlers made by Esper. The fix triggered an issue that the events didn't arrive in order by the List handler
        * add dependencies to run in linux
        * loading configuration file from the given Class instead of the given ClassLoader. This was making the loading fail.
