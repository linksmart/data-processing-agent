/**
 * This interface represent the needed data to trigger a Complex-Event Machine Learning processes.
 * This means, real-time analysis or learn based on streams.
 *
 * The Complex-Event Machine Learning processes consist in 5 phases.
 * 1) data propagation:
 *      a) Introduce propagate data into the process
 *      b) Propagate the results and the state of the process out
 * 2) Pre-processing data
 * 3) Continuous Learning
 * 4) Evaluation
 * 5) Deployment
 *
 * To realize this process the CEML leverage in the IoT Data-Processing core functionality.
 *
 * Phase 1.a)
 *      The data acquisition from a communication protocol is done by a IncomingConnector and process into the CEPEngine by a Feeder
 * Phase 2)
 *      The pre-processing is done in a CEPEngine by simple Statements without handlers or with LearningStatements
 * Phase 3)
 *      The Learning uses the result of the LearningStatement given by the CEPEngine and introducing it to the Models, which uses the DataDescriptors to configure themselves.
 * Phase 4)
 *      Made by the Evaluators defined in each models.
 * Phase 5)
 *      The actions taken by the agent with the model can be defined by typical Statements
 * Phase 1.b)
 *      The data is propagate to a communication protocol by a Handler.
