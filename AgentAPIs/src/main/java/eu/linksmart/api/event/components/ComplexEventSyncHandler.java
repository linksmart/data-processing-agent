 * The difference between the CESH and the @link ComplexEventHandler is that the implementation of the handling is
 * for synchronous request. While typical are asynchronous where the handling happens any moment after a statement was deployed
 * in a CEPEngine implementation, the CESH handels the event at the moment the statement is deployed.
