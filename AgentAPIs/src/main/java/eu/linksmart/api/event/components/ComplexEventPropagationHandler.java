/**
 * Interfaces which represents the API of the Complex Event Propagation Handler (CEPH).
 *
 * The CEPH does similarly as the @link ComplexEventHandler. <p>
 * The handler takes the needed steps to handle the event as the ComplexEventHandler.<p>
 * Additionally, the end objective of the CEPH is to propagate end result of the handling through the Network.<p>
 *
 * The handling result, aka complex/compound event will be packed in an enveloped by @link Enveloper, serialized into bytes by
 * a @link Serializer and propagate through a transport protocol using a @link Publisher.
