IoT Agents
===================

Implementation of the [IoT Agents](https://docs.linksmart.eu/display/LA).

## Code structure

The code structure is the following:

* `/AgentAPI` - Definition of APIs in form of Java interfaces and simple `JavaBeans`.
* `/Applications` - Implementation of the stating point of the application. E.g. in plain Java the `main` function or in OSGi the `Activation` class.
* `Applications/ServiceLouncher` - is the common application starter using a `main` function. 
* `/cemlComponents` - Implementation of the CEML framework. This is an extension of the IoT Data-Processing agent that transform it into the IoT Learning Agent.
* `cemlComponents/ComplexEventMachineLearning` - main implementation classes of the CEML framework. 
* `cemlComponents/CemlRestAPI` - implementation of the REST API of the CEML framework. 
* `cemlComponents/Models` - inclusion of Learning Models for the IoT Learning Agent using the CEML framework. 
* `cemlComponents/Models/AutoregressiveNeuralNetworkModel` - Using the `DeepLearning4J` libraries this is an implementation of the Autoregressive Neural Network Algorithm.
* `cemlComponents/Models/LinearRegressionModel` - simple implementation of a model for testing proposes.
* `cemlComponents/Models/PythonModelsIntegrator` - connector using Pyro to allow the usage of Python in the IoT Learning Agent.
* `/cepComponents` - Here there are the implementations of the different integrations to Complex-Event Processing Engines and DataTypes integrations and other Tooling using by them (CEP and DataTypes).
* `cepComponents/SiddhiWrapper` - Implementation of the integration of the Agent to the WSO2 CEP engine. 
* `cepComponents/cepTooling` - Some utility function that can be used inside the CEP engines. 
* `cepComponents/payload` - Implementation of several standards supported by the IoT Agents, such as OGC SensorThings. 
* `/DataProcessingCore` - Main implementation of the IoT Agent API and the main functionalities.
* `/distributions` - Packing of the code into executable artifacts.
* `distributions/IoTAgent` - Basic Java JAR distribution of the IoT Agent including WSO2 CEP Engine and the CEML Framework. 
* `/test` - Related code to Continuous Integration and other testing related tasks.
* `/test/dpa-rest-integration` - Integration Test of the DPA.
* `/Utils` - Generic code used in several places.
