/**
 *
 * In OGC SensorThing 1.0:
 *     The Location entity locates the Thing or the Things it associated with. A Thing’s Location entity is defined as the last known location of the Thing.
 *     A Thing’s Location may be identical to the Thing’s Observations’ FeatureOfInterest. In the context of the IoT, the principle location of interest is usually associated with the location of the Thing, especially for in-situ sensing applications. For example, the location of interest of a wifi-connected thermostat should be the building or the room in which the smart thermostat is located. And the FeatureOfInterest of the Observations made by the thermostat (e.g., room temperature readings) should also be the building or the room. In this case, the content of the smart thermostat’s location should be the same as the content of the temperature readings’ feature of interest.
 *
 *     However, the ultimate location of interest of a Thing is not always the location of the Thing (e.g., in the case of remote sensing). In those use cases, the content of a Thing’s Location is different from the content of theFeatureOfInterestof the Thing’s Observations. Section 7.1.4 of [OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011] provides a detailed explanation of observation location.
