/**
 * Created by José Ángel Carvajal on 04.04.2016 a researcher of Fraunhofer FIT.
 * Implementation of {@link FeatureOfInterest} interface
 * An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon.
 * The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011].
 * In the context of the Internet of Things, many Observations’ FeatureOfInterest can be the Location of the Thing.
 * For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (i.e., the living room where the thermostat is located in).
 * In the case of remote sensing, the FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
